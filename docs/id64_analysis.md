# Elite Dangerous `id64` (System Address) Analysis

This document details the nature and significance of the `id64` value, also known as the System Address, used to identify star systems in Elite Dangerous.

## 1. What is `id64`?

The `id64` is a 64-bit integer that serves as the **globally unique and stable identifier** for every star system in the Elite Dangerous galaxy.

*   **Uniqueness:** Every star system has a unique `id64`. No two systems share the same one.
*   **Stability:** This ID is assigned by Frontier's Stellar Forge procedural generation engine and does not change. It is the canonical identifier for a system.
*   **Importance:** Third-party tools like EDSM, Inara, and Spansh all use `id64` as the primary key for star systems. This allows for perfect data correlation between different community databases.

## 2. Implicitly Encoded Information

A key feature of the `id64` is that it contains implicitly encoded information, but only for certain attributes.

### Spatial Coordinates (Implicitly Encoded)

A system's approximate X, Y, and Z coordinates **are** implicitly encoded within its `id64`. The `id64` is not just a random number; it is an output of the procedural generation process that places the system in the galaxy.

The community has successfully reverse-engineered the algorithm that can derive a system's coordinates from its `id64`. This is how services like EDSM can provide "estimated coordinates" for systems that have not yet been visited and triangulated by players. The relationship is based on a galactic Octree structure, where different bits of the `id64` correspond to the system's position within the tree.

### Other Attributes (Not Encoded)

Other system attributes are **not** directly encoded in the `id64`. This includes:

*   System Name
*   Primary Star Class
*   Faction Allegiance and Government
*   Population

These properties are either generated by the Stellar Forge using the `id64` as a complex "seed" for its algorithms, or they are discovered and reported by players. The `id64` is the starting point for generating these attributes, but it is not a compressed representation of them.

## 3. Community Reverse-Engineered Algorithm

The community has done extensive work to understand and replicate the `id64`-to-coordinate algorithm. The best resources to start exploring this are:

*   **Primary Resource (Implementations):**
    *   **Project:** `klightspeed/EliteDangerousRegionMap`
    *   **URL:** [https://github.com/klightspeed/EliteDangerousRegionMap](https://github.com/klightspeed/EliteDangerousRegionMap)
    *   **Description:** This GitHub repository is an invaluable resource, providing working implementations of the logic in Python, C#, JavaScript, and Rust. It focuses on determining a system's region from its `id64`, which involves the core logic of decoding its spatial information.

*   **Conceptual Overview (Bit Structure):**
    *   **URL:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3xtz3d/system_address_id64_structure/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3xtz3d/system_address_id64_structure/)
    *   **Description:** This Reddit discussion provides a high-level breakdown of the 64-bit address, explaining how different bit-fields relate to a system's position within the galactic Octree. This is a good place to start for a conceptual understanding before diving into the code.
